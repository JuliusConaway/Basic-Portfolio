            Hello, my names is Julius Conaway and I am enrolled in Rutgers Coding Boot Camp aspiring to
            use code to change the world. I am a 32 year old man with 4 children in which 2 are 5 month old
            twins. I know what your'e thinking, what kind of mad man goes back to school with a set of
            newborn twins and 2 more growing boys? Well I would like to answer that question with one of my
            own. If a bumble bee areodynamically doesn't have wings big enough to lift it's body how does it fly?
            The answer is because it has to! If bumble bees didn't fly there would be a shortage of pollination.
            Which would undoubtly disrupt the worlds ecological balance. No matter how hard or unlikely it must.
            Staying on the ground is not an option so if you have to go against comfortability, reason, and
            practicality to fly then you DO. I am from a place where the people in masses can only struggle
            to survive or die, but no one realy lives. I am striving to change all that for my hometown of
            Newark,NJ. I was raised by a single mother and never had a relationship wiht my biological father
            which is pretty much the norm where I am from but this is just another obstacle I believe can be
            overcome using code. I graduated from one of the top high schools in Newark at the time, Science
            Park High School, at the age of 16 years old and was in college by the age of 17. Life has been
            a roller coaster ride and I belive it has yet to climb to the heights that code will take it to.
            As far work goes I am currently employed with Westrock International a corrugated paper plant
            and a member of the Steel Workers Union in Newark. I have been recognized for my steller work ethic
